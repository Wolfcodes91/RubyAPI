# Ruby on Rails Drinks API 

### Getting Started
## Use the command "rails s" in the terminal to spin up localhost:3000
## [Sample Link](http://localhost:3000/api/drinks/?tags=rum&sortBy=idDrink&direction=asc)

### Info
Change the Query strings in the url in order to search the API for different cocktail ingredients.
Add categories after "tags=" - example (?tags=vodka) - try with the tags vodka, rum, tequila, and gin. Add all of those tags if you want and get all of the drinks with all of those liquors. Next is sortBy, - example (&sortBy=strDrink) - after "sortBy=" you may type idDrink to sort your results by ID, or strDrink to sort your results by name. The sorting will default to ascending order. If you would like to change the direction of the sorting you can add the direction query - example (&direction=asc) - you may choose asc for ascending order or desc for descending order. Any other directional command will result in an error. Happy querying and I hope you have fun exploring the different cocktails.
